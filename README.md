# sentiment-analysis-tensorflow
Sentiment analysis of social media texts with Deep Learning.

Positive sentiment model & Negative sentiment model are trained separately.
Then, both models should be combined for the prediction of 3-class (including Neutral) sentiment analysis. 

There are 2 types of models:
- Medium text sentiment analysis - CNN RNN based.   
- Short & informal text sentiment analysis - Word & Character level RNN based.  

Could be used with or without pre-trained word embeddings.  
A loss weight matrix for different mis-classification cases.
